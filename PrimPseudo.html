### Pseudocode for Prim's Algorithm

1. Initialize:
   - Create an empty set `MST` to store the edges of the Minimum Spanning Tree.
   - Create a priority queue `minHeap` to store edges with their weights.
   - Create a set `visited` to keep track of visited vertices.
   - Choose an arbitrary starting vertex `startNode`.

2. Add the starting vertex to the priority queue:
   - Insert `(0, startNode, None)` into `minHeap` (weight, vertex, parent).

3. While the priority queue is not empty:
   - Extract the edge with the smallest weight from `minHeap`.
   - If the extracted vertex is not in `visited`:
     - Add the vertex to `visited`.
     - If the vertex has a parent (i.e., it's not the starting vertex), add the edge to `MST`.
     - For each adjacent vertex of the extracted vertex:
       - If the adjacent vertex is not in `visited`, add the edge to `minHeap`.

4. Return `MST`.

### Detailed Pseudocode

```
function Prim(graph):
    MST = []  # List to store the edges of the Minimum Spanning Tree
    minHeap = PriorityQueue()  # Priority queue to store edges with their weights
    visited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited vertices
    startNode = any vertex from graph  # Choose an arbitrary starting vertex

    minHeap.insert((0, startNode, None))  # Insert the starting vertex with weight 0

    while minHeap is not empty:
        weight, node, parent = minHeap.extractMin()  # Extract the edge with the smallest weight

        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)  # Mark the vertex as visited

            if parent is not None:
                MST.append((parent, node, weight))  # Add the edge to MST

            for neighbor, edgeWeight in graph[node]:  # Iterate through adjacent vertices
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    minHeap.insert((edgeWeight, neighbor, node))  # Add the edge to the priority queue

    return MST  # Return the Minimum Spanning Tree
```
